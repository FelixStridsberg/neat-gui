# NEAT GUI

Graphic visualization library for the [NEAT](https://github.com/FelixStridsberg/neat) project.

_(This is a separate project because GUI is boring so I always make it messy. Trying to avoid mess in the main project.)_

For example usage, see the [neat-race](https://github.com/FelixStridsberg/neat-race) project.

## Features

- Change all NEAT settings in real time.
- Step, start and stop evaluation at any time.
- Start and stop simulation at any time.
- Save and load network from file. (Buggy in the NEAT project still.)
- Information about the current state of the network.
- Graph with fitness over time.
- Area chart with species proportions over time.
- Each species has it's own color for the graphs and visualizations to use. (Buggy with reoccurring colors when many species.)
